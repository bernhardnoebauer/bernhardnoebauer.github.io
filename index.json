I estimate rent gradients for 734 cities world\\-wide using internationally comparable data on Airbnb objects. The average elasticity of rent to distance to the city center is -0.06. Rent gradients are less pronounced in cities that are smaller, situated by a large body of water, or located in upper-middle-income countries. Density gradients are more negative than rent gradients for most cities. Combining the two, I estimate the elasticity of transportation costs to distance to the city center to be around 0.3 on average, which implies a concave transportation cost function. This procedure relates closely to an approach Duranton and Puga (2022) use to determine their model's urban cost parameter. While I precisely match their estimate of 0.07 for the United States, my global estimate of 0.3 suggests that the US might be an outlier.","tags":null,"title":"Urban gradients: rent, density, and transportation costs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676509200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676509200,"objectID":"c928035eeeaf46ad41f6a7ce4b0c35ed","permalink":"https://bernhardnoebauer.github.io/publication/myanmar/","publishdate":"2023-02-16T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/myanmar/","section":"publication","summary":"I study the effect of trade in mining goods on conflict events in the border region of Myanmar. Using a shift-share measure, I disaggregate national exports to the township level. Imports from other low and middle-income countries are used to construct an instrumental variable to rule out reverse causality. A two-way fixed effects model is used for estimation. Export exposure to mining goods is associated with an increase in violent conflict. This increase predominantly affects townships inhabited by ethnic minorities. A placebo test confirms that the production of mining goods drives the effect. Night lights close to the mines are brighter in years with high export exposure, but surrounding areas do not seem to benefit.","tags":null,"title":"Trade and Conflict in Myanmar: A Reverse China Shock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Marius Brülhart and Mélise Jaud"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600390800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600390800,"objectID":"5ed0f7f77aef88b74d6371003f3b8659","permalink":"https://bernhardnoebauer.github.io/publication/worldbank/","publishdate":"2020-09-18T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/worldbank/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the evolution of nightlights in Myanmar's border regions between 2013 and 2019, a period of pronounced trade liberalization. We find towns on busy border crossings with China and Thailand to have grown disproportionately, as did some towns further inland along border crossing road corridors. However, rural areas in border regions between the main towns did not seem to benefit from the increased trading opportunities, nor did locations situated off the main road corridors. Moreover, border regions with India even saw a reduction in average nightlight intensity, and light growth on the foreign side of border crossings was generally more pronounced than on the Myanmar side. Our findings suggest that political tensions and other constraints might be preventing Myanmar border-region populations from benefiting from the opportunities of cross-border trade.","tags":null,"title":"Economic Development in Myanmar’s Border Regions: Evidence from Nightlights","type":"publication"}]
