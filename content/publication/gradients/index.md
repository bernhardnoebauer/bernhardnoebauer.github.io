abstract: I use the monocentric city model to relate the rent gradient and the density gradient to a third gradient describing transportation costs. I estimate rent gradients for 734 cities world\-wide using internationally comparable data on Airbnb objects. The average elasticity of rent to distance to the city center is -0.06. Rent gradients are less pronounced in cities that are smaller, situated by a large body of water, or located in upper-middle-income countries. Density gradients are more negative than rent gradients for most cities. Combining the two, I estimate the elasticity of transportation costs to distance to the city center to be around 0.3 on average, which implies a concave transportation cost function. This procedure relates closely to an approach Duranton and Puga (2022) use to determine their model's urban cost parameter. While I precisely match their estimate of 0.07 for the United States, my global estimate of 0.3 suggests that the US might be an outlier.
